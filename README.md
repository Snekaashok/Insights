**Market Basket Insights**

This project aims to provide valuable insights into market basket analysis, a fundamental technique in retail analytics. Market basket analysis helps businesses understand customer purchasing patterns by uncovering associations between products frequently purchased together. By analyzing transaction data, this repository offers a set of tools and algorithms for identifying these patterns and extracting actionable insights.

**Key Features:**

- **Apriori Algorithm**: Discover frequent itemsets and association rules to reveal product relationships within transactions.
- **Visualizations**: Generate interactive visualizations, such as heatmaps and network graphs, to intuitively showcase item associations.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Implement a recommendation system based on user purchase history and similar customer behavior.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess transaction data for efficient analysis.
- **Scalability**: Scalable algorithms to handle large transaction datasets efficiently.
